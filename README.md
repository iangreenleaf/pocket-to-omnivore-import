# Pocket permanent library => Omnivore

A little script that I made to import my huge collection of links from [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) to [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/home).
While Omnivore has Pocket import built in, I wanted to keep the full contents of articles from my Pocket permanent library.
